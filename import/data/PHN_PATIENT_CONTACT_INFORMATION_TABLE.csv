She can stay with Dr. Knauss as her PCP, but she is only enrolled for 6 mos in our program as we do not offer ongoing chronic care and management.  If the doctor chooses to not charge her after that, that is fine, but we will not support, with our program of pro bono charity care, for ongoing primary care needs,even for a phn volunteer.  We will asst this time with baseline diagnostics and if a specialty need is identified, Dr. K can refer her to us for help with that consult.  If she wants us to be of further service, she would need to find cost effective care other than a volunteer doctor. SS","PHN CENTRAL",
