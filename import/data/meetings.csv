The lady at the front desk pointed him out as he happened to be entering the building as we were having that discussion. This day I learned that Mr. Allen is the Site Manager. I introduced myself and explained our program for CBfB. He then led me to his family services representative Ms. King. I introduced myself to her and learned they didn't have any referrals and were very unfamiliar with how CBfB works. I left her some referrals and she said she would tell her parents about CBfB. ",44
